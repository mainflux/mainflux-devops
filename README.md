### Installation

> *N.B.* Most of the procedures about setting-up TLS in NGINX are taken from

> Change `nginx.conf` to use `www-data` as a user if you are on Debian
(on Alpine Linux which is used for Docker user is `nginx`).

```bash
sudo sh install-env.sh
```
Reload nginx config:
```bash
sudo service nginx reload
```
